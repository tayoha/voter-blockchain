## Installation
Before cloning the project, let's make sure you have the correct dependencies.

1. Make sure you have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), [`node`](https://nodejs.org/), [`truffle suite`](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), and [`metamask`](https://metamask.io/) installed.
    - On Mac OS X and Linux using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) makes it easy to manage `node` versions.
    - On Windows you may want to try [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist).
2. Clone this repository locally.
3. Run `npm install`, if you encounter errors during this step, deleting `package-lock.json` before running the command may be helpful.
4. Run `truffle compile` and open up ganache (can also run `ganache-cli` if you prefer non-GUI).
5. Run `truffle migrate` and verify that the contracts are deployed successfully.
6. Execute `npm run dev`, this will start the local client and listen to any changes on that port.
7. Navigate to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
